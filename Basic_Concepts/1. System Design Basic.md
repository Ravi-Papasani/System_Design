# System Design Basics

## Design considerations for a large-scale system

1. What architectural pieces can be used for system design.
2. How do these elements/pieces fit together.
3. How to make the best use of these requirements and how to properly weigh?

It is unwise to design extensions for the system, before the requirements are uncertain. But prioritizing the design can save valuable time and resources in the future.
