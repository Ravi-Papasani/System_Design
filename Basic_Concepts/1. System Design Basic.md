# System Design Basics

## Design considerations for a large-scale system

1. What architectural pieces can be used (architectural pieces)
2. How do these elements/pieces fit together
3. How to make the best use of these requirements: how to properly weigh

It is unwise to design extensions before the requirements are uncertain. But prioritizing the design can save valuable time and resources in the future.
